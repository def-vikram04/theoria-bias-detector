**BIAS DEFINITION** 

**1} FRAMING BIAS :** 

It’s when you tell something in a way that makes people see it differently, even though it’s the same basic fact.

 *Example 1:*

* “90% fat-free” vs. “contains 10% fat”

  * Both mean the same thing.

  * But “90% fat-free” sounds healthy.

  * “10% fat” sounds unhealthy.

 *Example 2:*

* “Freedom fighters” vs. “terrorists”

  * Same group.

  * One sounds heroic.

  * One sounds evil.

 *Example 3:*

* “We must accept some deaths to save the economy.”

  * Focuses on the economy, downplays human cost.

 *Example 4:*

* “Protesters disrupted the city.”

  * Makes them sound like troublemakers.

  * Alternative: “Citizens exercised their right to protest.”

**2} CONFIRMATION BIAS :** 

It’s when you only look for things that agree with what you already believe.

* You think your favorite team is the best.

* You only watch highlights when they win.

* You ignore the games they lose.

 *Example 2:*

**3} ANCHORING BIAS :** 

It’s when the first thing you hear sticks in your mind and affects all your decisions.

 *Example 1:*

* A shirt is **₹2000** but “on sale” for **₹1000**.

* You think ₹1000 is cheap, even though it’s just a marketing tactic.

 *Example 2:*

* The first news reports that the COVID-19 fatality rate is 0.1%.

* Later data shows it’s higher.

* People keep saying, “It’s only 0.1%.”

 *Example 3:*

* Seller says: “Normally ₹10,000, but I’ll give it for ₹7000.”

  * You feel it’s a deal, even if ₹7000 is overpriced.
